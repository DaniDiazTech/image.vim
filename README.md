# image.vim
View images in Vim, because Vim is awesome!



Features
=========
* Let's you pre-view images in Vim!
* It's safe, never modifies the original image

Requirements
============
* Vim with *python* support. You can verify if your Vim is compiled with python using:
  
  `vim --version | grep python`

  If you see `+python`, your Vim has python support. If not, figure out how to get one.

* Also needs the Python library PIL. You can install PIL using `pip install Pillow`

Thank you!
